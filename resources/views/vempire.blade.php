            <h1 style="color:white">The forest whispers my name</h1>
            <p style="color:white;">
                Black candles dance to an overture<br />
                but I am drawn past their flickering lure<br />
                to the breathing forest that surrounds the room<br />
                where the vigilant trees push out of the womb<br />
                <br />
                I sip the blood-red wine<br />
                my thoughts weigh heavy with the burden of time<br />
                from knowledge drunk from the fountain of life<br />
                from Chaos born out of love and the scythe<br />
                the forest beckons with her nocturnal call<br />
                to pull me close amid the baying of wolves<br />
                where the bindings of christ are downtrodden with scorn<br />
                in the dank, odiferous earth<br />
                <br />
                We embrace like two lovers at death<br />
                a monument to the trapping of breath<br />
                as restriction is bled from the veins in my neck<br />
                to drop roses on my marbled breast<br />
                I lust for the wind and the flurry of leaves<br />
                and the perfume of flesh on the murderous breeze<br />
                to learn from the dark and the voices between<br />
                <br />
                This is my will...<br />
                <br />
                The forest whispers my name... again and again<br />
                <br />
                I walk the path<br />
                to the land of the Dark Immortals<br />
                Where the hungry ones will carry my soul<br />
                as the wild hunt careers through the boughs<br />
                <br />
                Come to me, my Pale Enchantress<br />
                In the moon of the woods we kiss<br />
                <br />
                Artemis be near me<br />
                in the arms of the ancient oak<br />
                where daylight hangs by a lunar noose<br />
                and the horned, hidden one is re-invoked<br />
                <br />
                The principle of Evil<br />
                evolution has been recalled<br />
                Beneath the spread of Magickal Aeon<br />
                I stand enthralled<br />
                ... In the whispering forest<br />
